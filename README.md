# What is the "Project_2_Portfolio" code?
- This is a "portfolio" website that we, the students, were required to create based off of a PDF given to us by Udacity.
- The page has to be laid out like the PDF, yet must also be responsive enough to be viewed on multiple devices of varying widths.
- We were given room to get creative with our methods of making the pages responsive, and the actual images/content on the page. The general layout, and basic function of the page, however, is required.

# How does someone view it?
- Clone, Fork, or Download the code locally.
- Then open up the index.html file in Google Chrome (or other browser) that you downloaded.
